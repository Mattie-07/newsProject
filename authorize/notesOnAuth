A session is a place to store data for the user to access across requests.
    every user that visits a sight has a unique session

In order for cookie sessions to be used the npm key word below needs to be installed
    npm install cookie-session
Then 
    const = cookieSession = require("cookie-session")

using req.session.name = "name"; is the way that we initialize the cookie with a value. This can be done in the index ('/') route and be used in different routes afterward with res.send(req.session.name)
Cookie Created!
Now at any point when someone goes to a different route, the cookie still remains on the client side.
